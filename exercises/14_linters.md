# Linters and tidying

## Exercise 14.1 - Robocop

1. First go through robocop documentation: https://robocop.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ 
2. Run robocop as it is to some of your test suite.
3. Then add cofiguration (.toml file or argument .txt file)
4. Run again and see that your configuration works.
5. Correct your linting errors from one test suite (we'll be testing Robotidy next so don't correct all of them).

## Exercise 14.2 - Robotidy

1. First go through robotidy documentation: https://robotidy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
2. Run robotidy to one of your test suites as it is.
3. Then add cofiguration (.toml file, the same is ok than robocop .toml).
4. Run again and see that your configuration works.
5. You may try to sync the configurations so that robotidy will correct things so that robocop is happy.

Tip: --diff lets you see the difference.
