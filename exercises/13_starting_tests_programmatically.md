# Starting tests programmatically

## Exercise 13 - Basic shell script to run tests

**Objective:** Learn how to use scripts to start Robot Framework test suites.

2. Execute your robot suite (you can pick one) to run in the shell script.

Additions:
3. You may add some tags to --include and add those to the run and run your whole test folder.
