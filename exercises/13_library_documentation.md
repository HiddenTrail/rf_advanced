# Library documentation (libdoc)

Documentation ensures that others can understand, maintain, and extend your work with ease. Robot Framework's libdoc tool provides a convenient way to generate keyword documentation from libraries and resource files.

## Exercise 13: Generating library documentation

**Objective:** Familiarize yourself with Robot Framework's libdoc tool. Learn how to generate keyword documentation for an existing custom library.

1. Generate library (libdoc) documentation (html) for your own library.
2. Review the library documentation:
    - Do you see all the keywords listed?
    - Does each keyword have a proper description, list of arguments, and return values if any?
    - Is the overall structure and format of the documentation clear and readable?
