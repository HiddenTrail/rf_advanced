# Dry-run and skip features

## Exercise 5.1 Dry-run

**Objective:** Familiarize yourself with Robot Framework's "dry-run" mode, which allows the execution of a test without actually running any keywords.

1. The task is to simply run you test cases with dry-run
2. You may also add some typo to one of your keyword and check if dry-run catches it.

## Exercise 5.2 Skip features

**Objective:** Learn how to skip tests or parts of tests in Robot Framework using the SKIP tag and the Skip keyword.

1. Create a Robot Framework test suite with three test cases.
2. Use the SKIP tag to skip one of the test cases.
3. Use the Skip keyword from the BuiltIn library to skip a part of a test case.
4. Run the test suite and observe the behavior of skipped tests and steps.
